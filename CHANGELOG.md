# 📜 Changelog - Fabric Server-Side Authentication Mod 🛡️

### 🔒 A shiny, secure, and slightly sarcastic authentication mod for Fabric servers!

We've been hard at work turning this mod from "it works... mostly" into something you can actually trust with your precious player logins. Buckle up — here's what's new! 🚀

---

### 🐛 Bug Fixes & Hotfixes
- **:bug: Fixed commands & helpers!**  
  No more cryptic errors when typing commands. They now behave like well-trained pets instead of feral cats. 🐱

- **💥 Hotfix for Movement Blocker & Logging**  
  Players were occasionally getting stuck in limbo (literally). Movement blocker now works properly, and logging no longer silently fails like that one friend who says "I'm fine" but clearly isn't. 😅

### 🏗️ New Features & Improvements

- **🛠️ Installed Limbo Framework**  
  Welcome to the void! Players now get gracefully sent to a custom limbo dimension during authentication. Perfect for that dramatic "are you worthy?" vibe. ⛩️

- **💬 Custom Messages Support**  
  Say goodbye to boring default messages! Now you can customize every login prompt, kick reason, and success message. Make your server sound friendly, strict, or just plain chaotic — your call! 🎭  
  _Example: "Welcome back, legendary builder... or are you an impostor? 👀"_

- **👮 Admin & User Commands!**  
  Full suite of commands added:
    - `/login <password>` – For the peasants (players)
    - `/register <password>` – First-time? Claim your identity!
    - `/authcore reload` – Admins only: Reload config without restarting (because who has time for that?)
    - `/authcore set-password <player> <new-password>` – When someone "forgot" their password for the 50th time 🙄
    - And more! Power corrupts... use wisely.

- **⚠️ Support for Violations!**  
  Track failed login attempts, suspicious behavior, and repeated offenses. Configure thresholds and automatic bans/kicks. The mod now judges players harder than a hardcore PvP veteran. ⚖️

- **📝 Custom Logger!**  
  Beautiful, color-coded, fully configurable logging. See who logged in, who failed (and how badly), and when someone tried to brute-force their way in. Now with timestamps, player UUIDs, and IP tracking.  
  _Because nothing says "security" like a detailed audit trail of someone's 47 failed password guesses. 🔍😂_

### 🎉 Final Words
This update brings the mod from "functional prototype" to "**production-ready with style**". Your server will now authenticate players faster, safer, and with significantly more personality.

Thanks for using this mod! Keep your passwords strong, your configs backed up, and your players... well, hopefully not too sneaky. 😏
